Downloading
----------------
For Linux, just download the .jar file and then click on it to run it.

linking to PDFs
-----------------
To set up the links to PDF files, follow `this guide <http://help.jabref.org/en/FileLinks>`_ and change  the directory to the main directory that the files are in on either windows or linux.

Opening multiple PDFS in same window
-------------------------------------
To make it so that QPDF viewer opens new tabs instead of new windows when opening multiple PDFs, just set QPDF viewer to default program to open PDFs on computer. To do this, right click on a PDF and look at properties.
